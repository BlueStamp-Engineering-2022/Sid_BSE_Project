# Raspberry Pi Image Recognition
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was installing TensorFlow Lite on the Raspberry Pi. Doing so lets me run an object detection model so that I can identify objects using a USB webcam. As you can see, if I point the camera at my laptop, it draws a box around it and detects that it is a laptop. During this process, I enjoyed learning how TensorFlow works. I was also able to educate myself on how to efficiently use a Linux terminal, which is a skill that I’ve developed a little in the past, but not to the same degree as I did during this project. Although installing TensorFlow originally seemed like an easy process, it turned out to not be one, as the full version of TensorFlow is not developed for use with the Raspberry Pi. Because of this, it is complicated to install and doesn’t perform very well. To remedy this, I switched to installing TensorFlow Lite, which performs much better. In the future, I would like to train a new model for object detection. One idea that I’ve started working on is a model that can detect what breed a dog is, which I would train using a dataset of 20,000 pictures of dogs from Kaggle.com.

# First Milestone
My project is Raspberry Pi Image Recognition, in which I used TensorFlow to detect objects from a USB webcam. My first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS. I used the Raspberry Pi Imager on my laptop to flash Raspberry Pi OS to an SD card and could then set the operating system up. I could now access the terminal to run commands so that I could install TensorFlow. show opening up terminal. I enjoyed learning about the different operating systems that are compatible with the Raspberry Pi and figuring out which one is the best for TensorFlow. Originally, the SD card had not been formatted properly, so the operating system could not be flashed. To solve the issue, I had to format the SD card correctly before running the Raspberry Pi Imager. Next, I will be installing TensorFlow on the Raspberry Pi so that I can run an object detection model on it.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the binary blaster, which is a game in which the player converts hexadecimal numbers to binary numbers. The device is battery powered and has two eight-segment displays along with four switches. This is my first milestone. I’ve finished assembling the device, and it is fully functional.After powering the device on, the game starts. The hexadecimal number is shown on the display, and I can put in the binary version using the buttons. During this project, I enjoyed being able to brush up on my soldering skills, as it’s something that I haven’t done in a while. One thing that I struggled on was the direction of the buttons. If they were put in the wrong way, their embedded LEDs would not light up. I had originally soldered three of the buttons the wrong way, so I had to cut the traces on the PCB and manually bridge a few pads to fix the issue.In the future, it might be interesting to edit the preinstalled code on the microcontroller to change the way that the game works.
